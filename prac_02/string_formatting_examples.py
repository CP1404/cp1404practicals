# The ‘old’ manual way to format text with string concatenation:
print("My guitar: " + name + ", first made in " + str(year))

# A better way - using str.format():
print("My guitar: {}, first made in {}".format(name, year))
print("My guitar: {0}, first made in {1}".format(name, year))
print("My {0} was first made in {1} (that's right, {1}!)".format(name, year))

# Formatting currency (grouping with comma, 2 decimal places):
print("My {} would cost ${:,.2f}".format(name, cost))

# Aligning columns:
numbers = [1, 19, 123, 456, -25]
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    print("Number {0} is {1:>5}".format(i + 1, numbers[i]))

# Another (nicer) version of the above loop using the enumerate function
for i, number in enumerate(numbers):
    print("Number {0} is {1:>5}".format(i + 1, number))



for i in range(0, 101, 50):
    print("{:3}".format(i))
